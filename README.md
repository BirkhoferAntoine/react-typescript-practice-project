# React Learning Sessions App

This project is a mockup React app designed for learners to explore and book educational sessions. With a focus on simplicity and ease of use, the app presents a curated list of learning sessions from which users can choose and book their preferred ones. Once booked, sessions appear in an "Upcoming Sessions" area, allowing users to keep track of their learning agenda.

## About The Project

The React Learning Sessions App is designed to facilitate easy access to educational content. Users can browse through a variety of sessions, get detailed information about each, and book the ones they are interested in. The app leverages React's powerful features and the Context API for state management, ensuring a seamless user experience.
